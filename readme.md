# UI Challenge 2

## Code 301

Y'all, there has got to be an easier, quicker way to style a dropdown menu. I am actually shocked. It looks like there USED to be an easier way, like 8 years ago, but now we're stuck with doing nonsense like this to make a FAKE dropdown that we can actually style. 

I combed through google and CSS tricks and this was the shortest thing I came up with, but it still looks like I tried to write The Next Great American CSS File.
